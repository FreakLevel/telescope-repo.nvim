# ü¶ò telescope-repo.nvim: jump around the repositories in your filesystem
<!-- end_remove -->

`telescope-repo` is an extension for [telescope.nvim][] that searches the filesystem for git (or other scm) repositories. Use cases include:
- If you don‚Äôt start vim from the shell (from a GUI or as the start command of a terminal), you are most likely in your `$HOME` directory. You then want to jump into your code as quickly as possible and this plugin can help!
- Sometimes, you have the definition of a function and use of it in different repositories  (e.g. a library you wrote and a program using this library). This plugin helps opening the two, for instance in two splits.

`telescope-repo.nvim` is based on [telescope-ghq.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-ghq.nvim)

## Installation

You need to add these in your plugin management system:
```lua
'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
'cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim'
```
And optionally, to load the extension:
```lua
require'telescope'.load_extension'repo'
```

## External dependancies

### Required

- [`fd`][] to find the repositories on the filesystem

[`fd`]: https://github.com/sharkdp/fd

### Optional

- [`glow`][] to preview markdown files, will fallback to [`bat`][] if not present (and uses `cat` if neither are present)

[`glow`]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow
[`bat`]: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat

## Usage

Run:
```
:Telescope repo list
```

`:Telescope repo list`

Running `repo list` and list repositories' paths.

| `<CR>` (edit)    | `builtin.git_files`  |

#### options

#### `bin`

Filepath for the binary `fd`.

```vim
" path can be expanded
:Telescope repo list bin=~/fd
```

#### `pattern`

Pattern of the scm database folder.

Default value: `[[^\.git$]]`

#### `cwd`

Transform the result paths into relative ones with this value as the base dir.

Default value: `vim.fn.getcwd()`

#### `tail_path`

Default value: `false`

#### `shorten_path`

Call `pathshorten()` for each path.

Default value: `false`

## FAQ

### Getting the repository list is slow

You can use your `.fdignore` to exclude some folders from your filesystem. If there is enough interest, [#1](https://github.com/cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim/issues/1) could further enhance this.

### How to use this plugin with Mercurial (hg), Pijul, Fossil‚Ä¶

Set the `pattern` option to `[[^\.hg$]]`, `[[^\.pijul$]]`‚Ä¶

```
lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[^\.hg$]]}
```

See also [#2](https://github.com/cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim/issues/2), in particular for Fossil.
